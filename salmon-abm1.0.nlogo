## WHAT IS IT?

An agent-based modeling (ABM) platform for simulating social-ecological (SE) dynamics of pacific salmon fisheries. ABMs consist of individual agents (think James bond) each with their own rule set defining how they behave in the model. By programming relatively simple rule sets for different agents and allowing the agents to interact with one another, different overall model behavioral outcomes may be observed and studied. The model is currently instantiated and validated for dynamics at the Kenai River. Running the model simulates the return of sockeye and Chinook salmon to the Kenai from the 1st of July through the middle of August. As the salmon return, dipnet, drift gillnet, and set gillnet agents attempt to harvest as much sockeye as they can. The dipnet fishermen fish from the beaches of the river using dipnets no wider than 5 ft., while the drift gillnet and set gillnet commercial fishermen hang large gillnets in the waters of Cook Inlet perpendicular to the flow of the current. Drift gillnetters are more mobile than the set gillnetters and can fish throughout the Inlet contingent upon regulations, while set gillnetters stake their nets on beaches and extend them out at an angle from the beach. Historically, set gillnet and drift gillnet fishermen take the largest share of the sockeye harvest, often times harvesting millions of sockeye salmon bound to Kenai. Recently though, the set gillnet fishery has seen years of restriction on allowed fishing time due to Chinook salmon by-catch; the return of Chinook salmon to the Kenai river is much smaller (~ 20,000 - 45,000) than the return of sockeye salmon (~ 2,000,000 - 6,000,000), and there is subsequent concern about the number of Chinook salmon having the opportunity to spawn (known as escapement). In order to quantify escapement, sonar counters are placed in the river to estimate daily passage of sockeye and Chinook salmon. This model was designed for the testing of different scenarios on sockeye and Chinook escapement and stakeholder harvest, such as alteration of stakeholder gear or fishing time in a way that maintains or maximizes sockeye harvest while minimizing Chinook by-catch.

## HOW IT WORKS

The dipnet, drift gillnet, and set gillnet agents follow simple behavioral rules centered around attempting to maximize salmon harvest. The stakeholder/fishermen agents are also influenced by "experience" parameters such as over-crowding of a given fishing location due to high density of stakeholders. Furthermore, the stakeholders are subject to obeying Alaska Department of Fish and Game (ADFG) regulations, e.g., dipnetters are limited to fishing between July 10 and July 31 from 6 AM to 11 PM. Parameters are currently set to values based on the validated model and on Fish and Game regulations. That being said, many of the parameters are easily altered in the model interface. For example, the beginning and ending of the drift gillnet fishing season may be altered using the "drift_season_start" and "drift_season_end" parameters.

The salmon agents are programmed to follow amino acid signatures back to their home tributaries. Salmon agents are seeded in the simulation using observed run-timing distributions reconstructed from ADFG sonar and harvest data. Users may select a proto-typical sockeye run-timing distribution to use ("Run-Type" parameter), or they may leave it as random. Type III runs have strong returns of sockeye during the third week, Type III-IV runs have the greatest return during the third and fourth weeks, and so on. Chinook salmon were found to only have one proto-typical run-timing distribution, hence there is no option for the user to alter this parameter. The timing of return of the sockeye and Chinook salmon may be altered to study the impacts of run compression due to climate change on salmon escapement and stakeholder harvest ("red_days_compressed" and "king_days_compressed" parameters). Users may also select the magnitude of returning salmon, if they desire ("sockeye-run-size" and "chinook-run-size" parameters).

## HOW TO USE IT

Due to the amount of computations performed, the model can be slow to run. Therefore, first adjust the model speed slider at the top of the UI of the model interface tab to "fastest". Next, hit the "setup" button in the upper left hand corner of the UI to generate a stochastic watershed background and instantiate the model with the selected parameter values in the UI. Please be patient, this step can take up to 5 minutes or so depending on the processing speed of your computer! Finally, hit the go button to begin the simulation. The simulation will run from the beginning of July until August 15th. The escapement and daily sonar count of sockeye and chinook salmon are graphed on the right side of the UI. The user can also observe stakeholder harvest on the right side of the UI.

NOTE: The model is in a constant state of improvement, and there may be the occassional bug.

## THINGS TO TRY

As the model is running, "emergency orders" are issued closing or opening different commercial fishing sections dependent on variables like stakeholder sockeye and/or Chinook harvest, date in the season, and salmon escapement. These emergency orders are based off of genetically evolved equations meant to mimic ADFG management behavior in limiting or increasing commercial fishing power during the fishing season. By default, these emergency orders are automatically issued in the simulation ("automatic-emergency-orders?" boolean). A fun alternative to try is to turn off the automatic emergency orders, and attempt to manually manage sockeye or Chinook escapement using the "drift-emergency-order", "kenai-set-emergency-order", and "kasilof-set-emergency-order" drop down menus on the right side of the UI. Setting the drop down to "Open" will open the given section on the next day, and vice versa for "Close". There are two set gillnet sections harvesting salmon from the Kenai, as indicated by the emergency order options. Think of opening or closing one section or the other as partial or full alteration of set gillnet fishing power. If you do turn off automatic emergency orders, try to limit sockeye escapement between 800,000 - 1,200,000, and try to allow for at least 20,000 Chinook to escape. It can be tricky, depending on run conditions! Also, don't be afraid to issue the emergency orders while the simulation is running! Simply hit the "go" button to pause the simulation, make your selection, then hit the "go" button again to resume the simulation, again. Other things to try could include altering set gillnet or drift gillnet net length or depth - it has been postulated that less Chinook by-catch would occur if set gillnet net depth was reduced, but there is concern over how it will effect sockeye harvest and subsequent escapement.

## NOTES

Again, there may be the occasional bug in the model. This is not a final release version, by any means. We're hoping to root out any remaining bugs as well as streamline and speed up the model, in the future!

## FUTURE WORK

We hope to adapt the model to study how culvert placement or river turbidity may impact salmon populations, escapement, and harvest. Culverts can alter flow characteristics to the point that salmon passage is hindered or impossible, and is especially harmful to young developing salmonoids that need mobility between different habitat locations. High levels of turbidity have been found to cause gill trauma and effect reproduction and growth. Turbdity also may reduce spawning habitat and cause damage to salmon redds (nests) containing eggs from spawning activity. With river turbidity in particular, understanding how stakeholders behave is an important factor; the Kenai Watershed Forum found that often times, river turbidity levels exceeded state regulatory levels in relation to background levels of turbidity due to motorboat traffic, i.e., even after taking into account the already silty nature of the river, turbidity violations occurred.
